# Phishing_URL_Detection_WebApp
A web application that uses a machine learning model to detect phishing websites in real-time. This project leverages a FastAPI backend and a simple vanilla JavaScript frontend to provide a quick and easy-to-use URL classification service.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Classifies URLs as "Phishing" or "Legitimate" instantly.

RESTful API: A robust backend built with FastAPI provides a clean API for predictions.

Efficient ML Model: Utilizes a pre-trained XGBoost classifier for high accuracy and performance.

Simple UI: A clean and straightforward user interface built with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

Scalable Backend: The backend is organized into logical modules (router, schemas, business logic) for easy maintenance and extension.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn

Machine Learning: XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Frontend: HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript (Fetch API)

Development: Jupyter Notebook
